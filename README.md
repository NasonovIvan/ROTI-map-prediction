# ROTI-map-forecast
Neural network for daily prediction of the ROTI map

## Abstract

ROTI (index of rate of total electron content (TEC) change) maps are constructed with the grid of 2° × 2° resolution as a function of the magnetic local time and corrected magnetic latitude. The ROTI maps allow to estimate the overall fluctuation activity and auroral oval evolutions, in general, the ROTI values are corresponded to the probability of the GPS signals phase fluctuations.

In this paper, the daily prediction of ROTI cards is implemented using machine learning methods.

## Main part

We will use the data of the ROTI maps for 2010-2020. Let's analyze these data, as well as index data for a similar time and try to find correlations.

In the figure below, we will plot the arithmetic mean of the ROTI maps for each day, for a month and a moving average for 400 days:

Now let's plot similar graphs for indexes:

It is possible to observe a good correlation of the ROTI maps data with the indices F10-7 and IMF-BZ. There is also a weak correlation with the KP index, but for the initial analysis and testing of the success of the forecast, we will use data from the F10-7 and IMF-BZ indices.

Let's analyze the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It can be seen that there is no need to reduce the dimension of the data.

In our work, we used the long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, which contains 10 neurons and it is the first layer of our neural network. The LSTM layer is followed by densely-connected layers with the number of neurons 512, 1024, 812 and 720. We specifically made two layers, the number of neurons in which is greater than in the output layer, because we wanted to enable the neural network to identify non-obvious features in the data.

We used ADAM as the optimizer for our neural network with default parameters. We chose the Huber function as the loss function because it is less sensitive to outliers in the data than the squared error loss.

The graph of the decreasing loss function can be seen in the figure below. The neural network was trained for 80 epochs and during all this time the training loss decreased when the value of validation loss grew slightly and at the end of training it became larger than the first one. This indicates a slight overfitting of the network, but in our case it is quite small and will not affect the final results. However, it can be seen that the validation accuracy does not increase, and even decreases in the middle of the training. Both of these phenomena are caused by a small amount of data, but for this task these facts are not critical and their impact on the final result is small.

### Indexes

We want to take data period from 2010 to 2020 years for training our NN. In data from 2021 to 2022 we are going to test our network and analyze the result.

- The **Kp index**, or the planetary K index, is considered a proxy for the energy input from the solar wind to Earth. It is based on the geomagnetic effects of solar particles, the local K values, as measured by ground-based magnetometers around the world at geomagnetic latitudes between 44 degrees and 60 degrees (northern or southern). The higher the Kp value, the stronger the geomagnetic disturbance. **Ap Index** - the 3-hourly ap (equivalent range) index is derived from the Kp index.

- The **Dst index** provides a quantitative measure of geomagnetic disturbance. It is derived from a network of geomagnetic observatories near the Earth's geomagnetic equator that map to the globally symmetrical equatorial electrojet (the "ring current"). The lower the Dst value, the stronger the geomagnetic disturbance. Positive variations in Dst are mostly caused by the compression of the magnetosphere from solar wind pressure increases.

- Penticton Solar Radio **Flux at 10.7 cm** - is an excellent indicator of solar activity. Often called the F10.7 index, it is one of the longest running records of solar activity. The F10.7 radio emissions originates high in the chromosphere and low in the corona of the solar atmosphere. The F10.7 correlates well with the sunspot number as well as a number of UltraViolet (UV) and visible solar irradiance records.

- ACE **Solar Wind** Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor - instrument sensors measure solar wind electrons at 1-900 eV energy and ions at 0.26-35 keV. SWEPAM data consists of ion and electron rates collected at each energy/charge (E/Q) step, polar lock direction, and azimuthal spin direction. A single spacecraft spin period of 12 seconds is sufficient for accumulation of count matricies to fully calculate the electron and ion distribution functions from which bulk moments (solar wind speed, density, temperature) can be calculated by ground data processing. Accumulated counts will actually be summed over one-minute intervals for increased statistical accuracy and for reduction of telemetry requirements.

- **IMF-BZ** - The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) plays a huge rule in how the solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere. The Bx and By components are not important for auroral activity and are therefor not featured on our website. The third component, the Bz value is perpendicular to the ecliptic and is created by waves and other disturbances in the solar wind. For a geomagnetic storm to develop it is vital that the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (Bz) turns southward. Continues values of -10nT and lower are good indicators that a geomagnetic storm could develop but the lower this value goes the better it is for auroral activity.
